### Hola! My name is Javi 🚲



🧬 I am a **web developer** and **graphic designer** from Barcelona. After 12 years working as a graphic designer and communication manager, in 2021 I decided I wanted a change and I enrolled in **Ironhack's WebDev bootcamp**.

🔭 I’m currently working as a **Teacher Assistant** in Web Development bootcamps at **Ironhack Barcelona**.

🌱 I’m currently learning **Vue** and **MySQL**.

⚡ Fun fact: some people know me as Javi, some as **JaviScript**.
